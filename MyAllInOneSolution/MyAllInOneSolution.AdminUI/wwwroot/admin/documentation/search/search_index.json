Only if they have the appropriate permission will they be able to execute the functionality. Managing Your Access Policy In order to manage your access policy, you will need to have the \u2018All\u2019 permission. Access Policy Management is available in the Settings tab, new policies can be added and removed here. After making any changes you will need to save your changes in order for them to take effect. To make use of this new policy, you will need to give this new claim to a user. Users can get permissions from multiple access policy statements. Only users with the \u2018All\u2019 permission are able to assign claims referenced in the access policy to themselves or other users. Warning: any user that already has the claim in the access policy you are adding will be given the permission. This is also true if an access policy is removed, where any users with that claim will lose that permission. Permissions Users without any permissions will be greeted with an unauthorized screen after logging in. There are three read/write permissions available, each giving access to different actions within AdminUI: User Manager This permission grants control over User and Role management Identity Server Manager This permission allows users to create and modify ClaimTypes, Clients, Identity Resources, and Protected Resources All This permission allows all of the above and control over Access Policy Management As of AdminUI 5.5.0/4.6.0 there are 3 read only permissions available: User Manager Read Only This permission a user the ability to view Users and Roles Identity Server Manager Read Only This permission allows to view ClaimTypes, Clients, Identity Resources, and Protected Resources All Read Only This permission combines the two read only permissions above By default, the 'AdminUI Administrator' role is set up by default with the All permission. This mapping cannot be removed. Access Policies and External User Stores If you are using an external user store (e.g. AzureAD) you may need to create access policies based on known claim types for your users. For example, you may want to create an access policy based on an external user's email claim type. To do this, navigate to the Access Policy view and click the 'Add Policy' button. Next, choose the claim type you wish to create the access policy against (in our case the email claim type), as well as the claim value you expect to satisfy the policy. Lastly, choose the AdminUI permission you wish to grant users who satisfy these conditions. Adding an Access Policy to a Client or User After creating your Access Policy as described in the Managing Your Access Policy section above you can add it to your client by clicking the 'Add Claim' button. You will be greeted with a modal that requires you to enter the 'Type' and 'Value' of the Claim you are wishing to add. These values correspond to the Claim Type and Claim Value of the access policy you have created. For example, if you are adding a client that requires the AdminUI Administrator Access Policy as shown below: You should be entering the Claim Type 'role' and the Claim Value 'AdminUI Administrator' into the 'Add Claim' modal in the edit client view as shown below. After saving these changes, your client should be able to interact with the AdminUI API correctly.

These can be setup in different forms, including a web.config file, a docker-compose.yml file or Azure appsettings. Note: In Azure or IIS environments variables are nested with either __ (Linux environments) or : (Windows environments). E.g: DataProtection:Persistence:Type Running AdminUI On a Different Port If you need to configure the ports for the website you can add the following section to your appsettings.json file: \"Kestrel\": { \"Endpoints\": { \"Http\": { //Your new Url Here \"Url\": \"http://localhost:5020\" } } } If you would like to see all possible config options for the Kestrel property you can find them here . Running AdminUI On a Different Path If you are not running AdminUI from the root URL (e.g., using a path like https://generalweb/myadminui), an additional step is required. This is necessary because the index.html file, from which the SPA starts running, has a default reference to the root of the URL: <base href=\"/\"> This refers to an HTML path, so adding a full stop before the slash will not work in all the cases. Instead, you need to update the href with the AdminUI path. The specific steps for this vary depending on how you deploy AdminUI: Using Nuget package You need to include the property in your csproj file. This property will overwrite the base href after building the index.html file. Using the example mentioned earlier (https://generalweb/myadminui), the configuration would follow this schema: <Project> <PropertyGroup> <AdminUiPath>/myadminui/</AdminUiPath> </PropertyGroup> </Project> Remember to include a slash at the end of the path. This has to be done from the csproj (build pipeline) as the Nuget AdminUI will replace the html files on build. Using Zips or installer In this case, manually change the path in the index.html file located in the wwwroot folder of your AdminUI. Do not confuse it with the parent wwwroot that holds the AdminUI folder and other apps. Following the example (https://generalweb/myadminui), the updated line should be: <base href=\"/myadminui/\"> Remember to include a slash at the end of the path. Using Docker In the AdminUI Dockerfile, include the following command changing \"myadminui\" with your own path: sed -i 's/<base href=\"\\/\">/<base href=\"\\/myadminui\\/\">/' /wwwroot/admin/index.html This has to be done from Docker as the Nuget AdminUI will replace the html files on build. Remember to include a slash at the end of the path. Also, notice the forward slashes are escaped with a backslash. AdminUI Configuration Settings Note: In AdminUI 4.2.0 and 5.1.0 onwards, the env.js file is no longer used for configuration and changes do not need to be made to this file.

Password (Optional) - The password for the certificate Filesystem data protection and persistence is intended for IIS installations - we recommend a using the KeyVault method for protection alongside a database for persistence and protection when installing AdminUI in Azure. TargetIdentityServer4 Flag Deprecated from v7.0 The TargetIdentityServer4 flag in the API Configuration is used to determine what version of IdentityServer you want your AdminUI to target. If you're working with an IdentityServer4 database, you'll want to set this flag to true . If you're working with a Duende IdentityServer database, you'll want to set this flag to false . This configuration setting will change how AdminUI displays certain entities such as Protected Resources, as well as if it will display certain views.

Logging with Azure Our recommended way to get logs out of AdminUI is to: Set the AzureAppServiceLogging application setting to true. Enable Application Logging (filesystem) in the App Service Logs section of the Azure portal: This will automatically set the log location of AdminUI to Home\\LogFiles\\Application\\Admin in the app service. Using this option will allow you to see logs from the Log stream page in the Azure portal. If you are having trouble getting logs out of your Azure installation by using the setting above then you can change the web.config. To get logs out in this scenario you can change the stdoutLogFile to a location in the log files directory.

Changes As mentioned above, AdminUI\u2019s connection creation has historically been based purely on using connection strings. AdminUI 6.7 adds a pluggable abstraction that allows for the decoupling from this old strategy. The abstraction is IDatabaseConnectionFactory and it initialized in AdminUI's service layer with the default implementation. The interface is defined thus: public interface IDatabaseConnectionFactory { // Create connection for the Identity database (Users, Claim Types, Roles etc.) public DbConnection CreateIdentityConnection(bool migration = false); // Create connection for the IdentityServer database (Clients, Resources, Persited Grants etc.) public DbConnection CreateIdentityServerConnection(bool migration = false); // Create connection for the Auditing DbContext public DbConnection CreateAuditRecordsConnection(bool migration = false); // Create connection for the Persisted Grants DbContext public DbConnection CreateOperationalConnection(bool migration = false); // Creates connection for the DataProtectionKey DbContext public DbConnection CreateDataProtectionConnection(bool migration = false); } The migration parameter in each method is used to distinguish whether the method is called by AdminUI as part of its normal operation or when running migrations (in case you need to distinguish).

This document will outline the basic implementations needed to achieve this integration within MongoDB using the official MongoDB.Driver package within our solution. MongoDB Configuration For our database, you will be using a locally hosting MongoDB database. To make things easier you can place MongoDB configuration in your appsettings.json file. \"IdentityDatabase\": { \"ConnectionString\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\", \"DatabaseName\": \"AdminUIUserStore\", \"UsersCollectionName\": \"Users\", \"RolesCollectionName\": \"Roles\", \"ClaimTypesCollectionName\": \"ClaimTypes\" }, You can also create an object to deserialize these configuration values: public class IdentityStoreDatabaseSettings { public string ConnectionString { get; set; } = null!; public string DatabaseName { get; set; } = null!; public string UsersCollectionName { get; set; } = null!; public string RolesCollectionName { get; set; } = null!; public string ClaimTypesCollectionName { get; set; } = null!; } To access this configuration object, add it to your service collection in the Program.cs class. builder.Services.Configure<IdentityStoreDatabaseSettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"IdentityDatabase\")); Implementing the entity models The first step to achieving NoSQL integration with AdminUI is to create concrete implementations of our new model interfaces found within the Rsk.CustomIdentity NuGet package. These interfaces are as follows: ISSOUser ISSORole ISSOClaim ISSOClaimType ISSOUser Implementation First, create an implementation of the ISSOUser interface. public class CustomSSOUser : ISSOUser { [BsonId] [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)] public string Id { get; set; } public string UserName { get; set; } public string Password { get; set; } public string Email { get; set; } public string ConcurrencyStamp { get; set; } public bool TwoFactorEnabled { get; set; } public string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } public bool IsBlocked { get; } public bool IsDeleted { get; set; } public bool LockoutEnabled { get; set; } public DateTimeOffset? LockoutEnd { get; } [BsonIgnoreIfNull] public ICollection<ISSOClaim> Claims { get; set; } = new List<ISSOClaim>(); //Not part of the ISSOUser interface. Included to make querying user roles easier. [BsonIgnoreIfNull] public ICollection<ISSORole> Roles { get; set; } = new List<ISSORole>(); } The fields contained within this interface are the foundations of a user within AdminUI. If you have any additional fields you wish to manage within AdminUI, you'll need to translate them to claims and place them in the Claims collection on the user class. There are a few MongoDB specific attributes on our CustomSSOUser class. Firstly, the [BsonId] attribute specifies the field to be used as the primary key for the object. Below the [BsonId] attribute, we have the [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)] attribute. This attribute is used to specify that the Id field on our object is to be seen (or represented) within MongoDB as an ObjectId type. The benefit of having the Id field represented as an ObjectId , is that we can offload the generating of unique ID's for the user object to MongoDB. The [BsonIgnoreIfNull] attribute specifies that if the Claims or Roles collections on the user object are null, serializing/deserializing shouldn't be attempted. This helps to avoid any unwanted serialization issues within the MongoDB driver. ISSORole Implementation Write an implementation of the ISSORole interface. public class CustomSSORole : ISSORole { [BsonId] [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)] public string Id { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } public bool NonEditable { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } ISSOClaimType Implementation Now, the implementation of the ISSOClaimType interface public class CustomSSOClaimType : ISSOClaimType { [BsonId] [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)] public string Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string DisplayName { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } public bool IsRequired { get; set; } public bool IsReserved { get; set; } public SSOClaimValueType ValueType { get; set; } public string RegularExpressionValidationRule { get; set; } public string RegularExpressionValidationFailureDescription { get; set; } public bool IsUserEditable { get; set; } public ICollection<string> AllowedValues { get; set; } } ISSOClaim Implementation And finally, the implementation of the ISSOClaim interface public class CustomSSOClaim : ISSOClaim { [BsonId] public int Id { get; set; } public string ClaimType { get; set; } public string ClaimValue { get; set; } } MongoDB Driver Class Mapping You must also register the class mapping within the MongoDB driver for the implementations. To do this, update your Program.cs class with the following: BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<CustomSSOUser>(); BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<CustomSSORole>(); BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<CustomSSOClaim>(); BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<CustomSSOClaimType>(); It's not a requirement for this code to be in the Program.cs class, you could also place it in the stores. However, the registration of the class maps must be present before any calls to the database wherein deserialization would take place. Store Implementations Now you must create implementations of the stores. This will mean creating implementations of the following interfaces: ISSOUserStore ISSORoleStore ISSOClaimTypeStore This will be the stores that are called withing AdminUI's service layer and contain all the methods AdminUI needs to work. ISSOUserStore Implementation Start by implementing the ISSOUserStore . This is the largest store in terms of implemented methods. // Implementation shortened for brevity public class UserStore : ISSOUserStore { private readonly IMongoCollection<CustomSSOUser> dbUsers; private readonly PasswordHasher<CustomSSOUser> passwordHasher; public UserStore(IOptions<IdentityStoreDatabaseSettings> dbSettings) { var mongoClient = new MongoClient( dbSettings.Value.ConnectionString); var mongoDatabase = mongoClient.GetDatabase( dbSettings.Value.DatabaseName); dbUsers = mongoDatabase.GetCollection<CustomSSOUser>( dbSettings.Value.UsersCollectionName); passwordHasher = new PasswordHasher<CustomSSOUser>(); } public async Task<ISSOUser> CreateUser(ISSOUser user) { var newUser = new CustomSSOUser { UserName = user.UserName, Email = user.Email, ConcurrencyStamp = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), TwoFactorEnabled = false, FirstName = user.FirstName, LastName = user.LastName, IsDeleted = false, LockoutEnabled = false, }; foreach (var claim in user.Claims) { newUser.Claims.Add(claim); } await dbUsers.InsertOneAsync(newUser); var createdUserQuery = await dbUsers.FindAsync(u => u.UserName == newUser.UserName); return await createdUserQuery.FirstOrDefaultAsync(); } You can see how to initialise the dbUsers collection using the injected IdentityStoreDatabaseSettings configured in the Program.cs file. In production, you may want to use a factory to abstract out this functionality. ISSORoleStore Implementation Next, implement the ISSORoleStore . //Implementation shortened for brevity public class RoleStore : ISSORoleStore { private readonly IMongoCollection<CustomSSOUser> dbUsers; private readonly IMongoCollection<CustomSSORole> dbRoles; public RoleStore(IOptions<IdentityStoreDatabaseSettings> dbSettings) { var mongoClient = new MongoClient( dbSettings.Value.ConnectionString); var mongoDatabase = mongoClient.GetDatabase( dbSettings.Value.DatabaseName); dbUsers = mongoDatabase.GetCollection<CustomSSOUser>( dbSettings.Value.UsersCollectionName); dbRoles = mongoDatabase.GetCollection<CustomSSORole>( dbSettings.Value.RolesCollectionName); } public async Task<ISSORole> CreateRole(ISSORole role) { await dbRoles.InsertOneAsync(new CustomSSORole { Name = role.Name, Description = role.Description, NonEditable = role.NonEditable }); var rolesInsertedName = await dbRoles.FindAsync(r => r.Name == role.Name); return await rolesInsertedName.FirstOrDefaultAsync(); } ISSOClaimTypeStore Implementation Finally, implement the ISSOClaimTypeStore //Implementation shortened for brevity public class ClaimTypeStore : ISSOClaimTypeStore { private readonly IMongoCollection<CustomSSOClaimType> dbClaimTypes; public ClaimTypeStore(IOptions<IdentityStoreDatabaseSettings> dbSettings) { var mongoClient = new MongoClient( dbSettings.Value.ConnectionString); var mongoDatabase = mongoClient.GetDatabase( dbSettings.Value.DatabaseName); dbClaimTypes = mongoDatabase.GetCollection<CustomSSOClaimType>( dbSettings.Value.ClaimTypesCollectionName); } public async Task<ISSOClaimType> CreateClaimType(ISSOClaimType claimType) { var newClaimType = new CustomSSOClaimType { Name = claimType.Name, DisplayName = claimType.DisplayName, Description = claimType.Description, IsRequired = claimType.IsRequired, IsReserved = claimType.IsReserved, ValueType = claimType.ValueType, RegularExpressionValidationRule = claimType.RegularExpressionValidationRule, RegularExpressionValidationFailureDescription = claimType.RegularExpressionValidationFailureDescription, IsUserEditable = claimType.IsUserEditable, AllowedValues = claimType.AllowedValues }; await dbClaimTypes.InsertOneAsync(newClaimType); var claimTypeQuery = await dbClaimTypes.FindAsync(ct => ct.Name == claimType.Name); return await claimTypeQuery.FirstOrDefaultAsync(); } ISSOStoreFactory Implementation Next, you will create an implementation of the ISSOStoreFactory . This is the factory used by the AdminUI service layer to create the instances of the stores you have already written. public class CustomSSOStoreFactory : ISSOStoreFactory { private readonly IOptions<IdentityStoreDatabaseSettings> dbSettings; public CustomSSOStoreFactory(IOptions<IdentityStoreDatabaseSettings> dbSettings) { this.dbSettings = dbSettings ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(dbSettings)); } public ISSOUserStore CreateUserStore() { return new UserStore(dbSettings); } public ISSORoleStore CreateRoleStore() { return new RoleStore(dbSettings); } public ISSOClaimTypeStore CreateClaimTypeStore() { return new ClaimTypeStore(dbSettings); } } Summary In this document you have created a NoSQL implementation of an Identity Store for AdminUI using the Rsk.CustomIdentity and MongoDB.Driver NuGet packages.

If you have any additional fields you wish to manage within AdminUI, you'll need to translate them to claims and place them in the Claims collection on the user class. There are a few MongoDB specific attributes on our CustomSSOUser class. Firstly, the [BsonId] attribute specifies the field to be used as the primary key for the object. Below the [BsonId] attribute, we have the [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)] attribute. This attribute is used to specify that the Id field on our object is to be seen (or represented) within MongoDB as an ObjectId type. The benefit of having the Id field represented as an ObjectId , is that we can offload the generating of unique ID's for the user object to MongoDB. The [BsonIgnoreIfNull] attribute specifies that if the Claims or Roles collections on the user object are null, serializing/deserializing shouldn't be attempted.

You can find the finished code on our GitHub we recommend reading the previous section to understand the code written so far. Tenancy Example using Entity Framework In this documentation you will be learning how to make a non-AdminUI field (one that is not on ISSOUser) editable within AdminUI using claims. The outcome of this documentation is to take an example user like the one below - one that has TenantName on it which is linked to the tenants table (fig2) And make them editable in AdminUI by using claims: Prerequisites There are 3 NuGet packages and a few external dependencies before you get started Nuget Packages EntityFramework EntityFramework.SqlServer EntityFramework.Design A SqlServer database An IdentityServer that can access your user store to login Database First you must create a database model and be able to scaffold and seed a database with some sample data to get AdminUI. In this section you'll be using EntityFramework to do so. Models To get started you will create the models that represent your Identity model: Tenant User TenantUser is the model that will represent users in your system. This model is based off of ISSOUser but does not implement all of the interface. This is for 2 reasons: We want to include the roles a user belongs to in the model The claims collection needs a concrete type for Entity Framework to work against and ISSOUser expects a collection of ISSOClaim public class TenantUser { [Key] public string UserId { get; set; } public string UserName { get; set; } public string Email { get; set; } [ConcurrencyCheck] public string ConcurrencyStamp { get; set; } public bool TwoFactorEnabled { get; set; } public string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } public bool IsBlocked { get; } public bool IsDeleted { get; set; } public bool LockoutEnabled { get; set; } public DateTimeOffset? LockoutEnd { get; } public string Password { get; set; } public virtual ICollection<TenantRole> Roles { get; set; } public virtual ICollection<TenantClaim> Claims { get; set; } public virtual Tenant? Tenant { get; set; } } Tenant Role Describes roles that a user can belong to - including the Users collection on this allows EF to create a many-many connection between the Users and Roles tables. public class TenantRole : ISSORole { [Key] public string Id { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } public bool NonEditable { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public virtual ICollection<TenantUser> Users { get; set; } } Tenant Claim Describes claims that a user has public class TenantClaim : ISSOClaim { [Key] public int Id { get; set; } public string ClaimType { get; set; } public string ClaimValue { get; set; } } Tenant The table representing tenants a user can belong to public class Tenant { [Key] public string Name { get; set; } } Tenant ClaimType ClaimTypes represent the ClaimType field on a TenantClaim . The main thing to note is your AllowedValues collection - this is how we will translate the Tenant table to a selectable list of values public class TenantClaimType { [Key] public string Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string DisplayName { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } public bool IsRequired { get; set; } public bool IsReserved { get; set; } public SSOClaimValueType ValueType { get; set; } public string RegularExpressionValidationRule { get; set; } public string RegularExpressionValidationFailureDescription { get; set; } public bool IsUserEditable { get; set; } public ICollection<TenantEnumClaimTypeValue> AllowedValues { get; set; } } Tenant Enum Claim Type Allowed Values This table ties allowed values to particular claim types. public class TenantEnumClaimTypeValue { public string ClaimTypeId { get; set; } public string Value { get; set; } } Create DBContext for Identity Your next step is to build a DbContext - a DbContext in EntityFramework is the primary class for interacting with your database, it has knowledge of all your tables and the relationships between them. As you're using Entity Framework to build the database (known as Code-First Entity Framework) you can let the models define most of the relationships, however a limitation in EntityFramework is that you cannot define composite keys at the model level, so you need to add an \"OnModelCreating\" override that defines the TenantEnumClaimTypeValue as a composite key of the claimType it belongs to and it's value public class CustomIdentityDb : DbContext { public CustomIdentityDb(DbContextOptions<CustomIdentityDb> options) : base(options){} protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder) { base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder); modelBuilder.Entity<TenantEnumClaimTypeValue>(enumClaimTypeValue => { enumClaimTypeValue.HasKey(ctv => new { ctv.ClaimTypeId, ctv.Value }); }); } public DbSet<TenantUser> Users { get; set; } public DbSet<TenantRole> Roles { get; set; } public DbSet<TenantClaim> UserClaims { get; set; } public DbSet<TenantClaimType> ClaimTypes { get; set; } public DbSet<TenantEnumClaimTypeValue> EnumClaimTypeAllowedValues { get; set; } public DbSet<Tenant> Tenants { get; set; } } Creating and Running Migrations Now that your database has been defined in code, you'll need to get it up and running. To do this, the Entity Framework tooling needs to know where your database in and what database engine to use. So in your startup register the DbContext with .AddDbContext and use the OptionsBuilder to register a SqlServer database. builder.Services.AddDbContext<CustomIdentityDb>(options => { options.UseSqlServer(@\"Server=localhost,1433;User Id=sa;Password=Password123!;Database=CustomIdentityDb;\"); }); In our sample the connection string is hardcoded for ease but it is also possible to get it from config if you please. From a terminal or command line, navigate to your project and run the following dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate - This is what creates the migrations. After this command is run you will have a new Migrations folder in your project. Secondly run dotnet ef database update - This command connects your project to the database server and uses the migrations previously generated to generate a database. Afterwards you can navigate to your database to confirm that it has been created successfully. Seeding the database Provided in the Program.cs of our sample solution is a commented out block of code to seed the database which does the following: Maps an HttpGet to the base path Injects the new DbContext you just created Creates an Admin role Creates 2 Tenants, Assigns the Admin Role and 1 Tenant to a new User - this is the use you will use to login to AdminUI It then creates a ClaimType that represents tenants. An important note is that this code does not populate the allowed values here as you will be filling that collection at a later time It is also required, meaning we will see it when editing user details and it is reserved, meaning no one can edit it from within AdminUI. If you would like to use the code snippet, put it above the app.Run call, comment out the app.useAdminUI call, uncomment the seed block and run your solution. Updating the stores & factory The next step is to write your services to inject your context so they can make database calls. You will also need to update your factory to As an example the User store will now look like: public class UserStore : ISSOUserStore { private readonly CustomIdentityDb _identityContext; public UserStore(CustomIdentityDb identityContext) { _identityContext = identityContext ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(identityContext)); } ... and the factory: public class CustomSSOStoreFactory : ISSOStoreFactory { private readonly CustomIdentityDb _identityDb; public CustomSSOStoreFactory(CustomIdentityDb identityDb) { _identityDb = identityDb ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(identityDb)); } public ISSOUserStore CreateUserStore() { return new UserStore(_identityDb); } ... Mapping the Tenancy field Now you will write the stores so they can make the conversion from field to claim happen. As a brief behind the scenes explanation when AdminUI gets a User it will get a list of claims for that user. This is a ClaimType-ClaimValue pair. AdminUI will then get all ClaimTypes and match that Claim's ClaimType to a ClaimType's Name The rest of the guide will not take you over all of the store methods, but the essential ones crucial to the process described above, starting with getting the Claim Types. ClaimType Store The main method to focus on in the ClaimType store is the GetAllClaimTypes method. This method: Gets all ClaimTypes from the database and maps them to our store level objects (something which implements ISSOClaimType) Finds the claim type that represents Tenant (This was added upon seed) Populates the Allowed Values collection on that object by calling off to the Tenants table and getting all the names from that table Returns the ClaimTypes public async Task<IEnumerable<ISSOClaimType>> GetAllClaimTypes() { var ctList = _identityContext.ClaimTypes.Include(claimType => claimType.AllowedValues) .Select(dbCt => dbCt.ToStoreClaimType()); var tenantCt = await ctList.FirstOrDefaultAsync(ctList => ctList.Id == TenantClaimTypeConsts.TenantCTId); tenantCt.AllowedValues = _identityContext.Tenants.Select(x => x.Name).ToList(); return await ctList.ToListAsync(); } User Store When Creating or Updating a user you must map the ClaimType that you received from the ClaimStore back from a Claim on the User to a field, for example your create should do the following: Map the incoming user to something that database can read Hash password if needed Grab the value of the Tenant claim from the passed in user Validate that the claim value matches a value in the tenants table Updates the users tenants field with that value Add, Saves and Returns C# public async Task<ISSOUser> CreateUserWithPassword(ISSOUser user, string password) { var dbUser = user.ToDbUser(); dbUser.ConcurrencyStamp = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); dbUser.Password = _passwordHasher.HashPassword(dbUser, password); var tenantName = user.Claims.FirstOrDefault(claim => claim.ClaimType == TenantClaimTypeConsts.TenantCTName)?.ClaimValue; dbUser.Tenant = await _identityContext.Tenants.FirstOrDefaultAsync(tenant => tenant.Name == tenantName); _identityContext.Users.Add(dbUser); await _identityContext.SaveChangesAsync(); var userInDb = await _identityContext.Users.FirstOrDefaultAsync(dbUsers => dbUsers.UserName == user.UserName); return userInDb.ToStoreUser(); } C# public async Task<ISSOUser> UpdateUser(ISSOUser user) { var dbUser = await _identityContext.Users.Include(dbUser => dbUser.Claims).Include(dbUser => dbUser.Roles).Include(dbUser => dbUser.Tenant).FirstOrDefaultAsync(dbUser => dbUser.UserId == user.Id); dbUser.Email = user.Email; dbUser.FirstName = user.FirstName; dbUser.UserName = user.UserName; dbUser.TwoFactorEnabled = user.TwoFactorEnabled; dbUser.LastName = user.LastName; dbUser.ConcurrencyStamp = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); var tenantClaim = user.Claims.FirstOrDefault(userClaim => userClaim.ClaimType == TenantClaimTypeConsts.TenantCTName)?.ClaimValue; var dbTenant = _identityContext.Tenants.FirstOrDefault(tenant => tenant.Name == tenantClaim); dbUser.Tenant = dbTenant; await _identityContext.SaveChangesAsync(); return dbUser.ToStoreUser(); } Then implement the UserStores Find methods such that when the ClaimType is encountered, you map the Tenant field to a new Claim that has the TenantClaimType as the ClaimType. For example the FindUserById method looks like this: public async Task<ISSOUser> FindUserById(string userId) { var dbUser = await _identityContext.Users.Include(user => user.Claims).Include(user => user.Roles).Include(user => user.Tenant).FirstOrDefaultAsync(user => user.UserId == userId); if (dbUser == null) { throw new UserNotFoundException(userId); } var storeUser = dbUser.ToStoreUser(); storeUser.Claims.Add(new SSOClaim(TenantClaimTypeConsts.TenantCTName, dbUser.Tenant.Name)); return storeUser; } IdentityServer Setup Your IdentityServer setup might not need changing but if you are starting from the Samples you will need to add a profile service like below public class TenantProfileService : IProfileService { private readonly CustomIdentityDb _dbContext; public TenantProfileService(CustomIdentityDb dbContext) { _dbContext = dbContext; } public async Task GetProfileDataAsync(ProfileDataRequestContext context) { var userId = context.Subject.FindFirstValue(JwtClaimTypes.Subject); var user = await _dbContext.Users.Include(user => user.Roles).FirstOrDefaultAsync(tenantUser => tenantUser.UserId == userId); if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(user?.UserName)) { context.IssuedClaims.Add(new Claim(\"name\", user.UserName)); } var userRoles = user.Roles; foreach (var role in userRoles) { context.IssuedClaims.Add(new Claim(\"role\", role.Name)); } } public Task IsActiveAsync(IsActiveContext context) { context.IsActive = true; return Task.CompletedTask; } }","title":"Tenancy With Entity Framework"},{"location":"CustomIdentity/TenancyWithEF.html#tenancy-example-using-entity-framework","text":"In this documentation you will be learning how to make a non-AdminUI field (one that is not on ISSOUser) editable within AdminUI using claims.

The IdentityExpress Admin UI integrates with an IdentityServer installation for authentication and authorization. AdminUI Deployment AdminUI is deployed a single Azure Web Application. It is envisaged that it will be configured to communicate with your existing (external) identity server. Prerequisites Before beginning installation, please ensure that you have downloaded: Latest version of AdminUI Installed IdentityServer4 or IdentityServer6 (Duende) , a sample can be found here that is already integrated with our IdentityExpress.Identity schema. Either a MySql , PostgreSQL , or SqlServer database set up Walkthrough If you already have a working IdentityServer installation up and running then this walkthrough is for you. This walkthrough will take you through the entire Azure configuration process, resulting in a working environment for IdentityExpress AdminUI which is in communication with your IdentityServer installation. This will also include migrating your user store to the AdminUI Identity Schema. Configure a Database AdminUI currently only supports MySql , PostgreSQL and SqlServer . These can run in any azure or non-azure service. Any used databases must accept remote connections, also ensure that your firewall allows connections on any used ports. Create Azure Website Initially you will want to create an Azure Web App (note this process can also be done with Azure VM's, though you will need to follow the AdminUI IIS Installation guide . AdminUI Configuration Once you have a Website created for AdminUI, you will need to add some variables to the site in order to get it to run. The variables to be aware of are: DbProvider This sets the database type you are using. Supported types and their values are SqlServer , MySql , or PostreSql IdentityConnectionString The connection string for your Identity database (users) IdentityServerConnectionString The connection string for your IdentityServer database (clients, resources & grants) AzureAppServiceLogging (optional) Used for debugging the API - see the enable logging page for more details. AuthorityUrl Url of the IdentityServer installation UiUrl Url of the AdminUI frontend RequireHttpsMetadata Set to true or false if you want to ensure IdentityServer discovery endpoint uses TLS. Must be true for production. AuditRecordsConnectionString The connection string for AdminUI audits, if missing will default to the IdentityServerConnectionString AuditRecordsCulture Language used for generation of audit records, if missing or invalid will default to English (en-GB), supported cultures and their values are: de German zh-TW Chinese (Traditional) zh-CN Chinese (Simplified) es Spanish fr French AuditReadActions Set to true or false , if missing will default to true , if false no audit records will be generated for read actions e.g when a user views resources though AdminUI AuthorityUrl Url of the IdentityServer installation. UiUrl Url of the AdminUI frontend (this Web APP). ApiUrl Url of the API setup in the previous step. AzureAppServiceLogging (optional) Used for debugging the UI - see the enable logging page for more details. In Azure, these variables will need to be added manually to the App Settings header in the Application Settings blade. For a full list of configuration settings, see Configuring AdminUI . Deploying to Azure Web App You will need to FTP the folders supplied to the correct Azure folder. To achieve this you will need an FTP Client such as Filezilla. Once you have an FTP Client setup, you will need to go in to the Deployment Credentials blade of your app underneath the deployment header and setup the FTP credentials. Next go into the Properties blade underneath the Settings Header. From this blade you can grab your FTP HOST NAME. Using your FTP Client, connect to this website, from here navigate to Site -> wwwroot. You will want to place the contents of the relevant folder in this wwwroot folder. Migrations Whether you are installing AdminUI for the first time or upgrading to the latest version of AdminUI, you will need to run some form of migrations to ensure your databases are inline with AdminUI If you extract the zip on your local machine, You can run the following command to migrate your database dotnet IdentityExpress.Manager.UI.dll -migrate all -connectionstring \"Server=tcp:example.database.windows.net;Database=ExampleDatabase;User ID=Username;Password=Password;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;\" -dbprovider SqlServer If you want more options when setting up your databases, then there are more fine tune migrations you can do, for more info see our full migration docs here Troubleshooting If you're having issues, we recommend you first enable logging . If the logs do not report any issues, the logs are reporting \"Could not find 'aspnetcorev2_inprocess.dll'\" or you see a screen with the following error: \"Http Error 500.32 - ANCM Failed to Load dll\", then the most likely culprit is that you are running AdminUI on a .NET Framework App Service and will need to make 2 modifications to the web.config file. First you will need to remove the hostingmodel=\"inprocess\" property from the <aspNetCore> element and change the AspNetCoreModule from V2 to V1 by modifying the <handlers> section like so: <handlers> <add name=\"aspNetCore\" path=\"*\" verb=\"*\" modules=\"AspNetCoreModuleV2\" resourceType=\"Unspecified\" /> </handlers> <aspNetCore processPath=\"dotnet\" arguments=\".\\IdentityExpress.Manager.UI.dll\" ... hostingModel=\"inprocess\"> </aspNetCore> to <handlers> <add name=\"aspNetCore\" path=\"*\" verb=\"*\" modules=\"AspNetCoreModule\" resourceType=\"Unspecified\" /> </handlers> <aspNetCore processPath=\"dotnet\" arguments=\".\\IdentityExpress.Manager.UI.dll\" ...> </aspNetCore> If you are still experiencing issues after this please don't hesitate to email us at support@identityserver.com","title":"Install in Azure"},{"location":"Installation/Installation_Azure.html#adminui-deployment","text":"AdminUI is deployed a single Azure Web Application.

To check this, run the docker-compose command Configuration Ports Port configuration in Docker follows the format host:container . e.g Changing the \"Ports\" section of AdminUI in the docker-compose file to 5001:6001 would mean you could contact AdminUI by browsing to http://localhost:6001 NOTE - Changing any of these will mean the configuration in the rest of the docker-compose file will have to change. Environment Variables Environment variables are also available for setting application specifics. If you are using the docker-compose file they are formatted as follows: environment: - UiUrl=http://localhost:5010 - ApiUrl=http://localhost:5011 - AuthorityUrl=http://ids:5013 The minimum configuration required is: DbProvider This sets the database type you are using.

If you are running locally, ensure that the AuthorityUrl setting uses the IP address of the local Docker network device - For Mac and Window this is possible by using host.docker.internal , on Linux localhost will work. For more information regarding networking with Docker on operating systems other than Linux please see here for Windows and here for MacOS. Any used databases must accept remote connections. If this database is on your Docker host machine, you can use the IP address of your Docker network device in the connection string. If you are running IdentityServer and the database locally to the Docker host machine, also ensure that your firewall allows connections on the necessary ports. Getting The Images The docker images used for AdminUI can be found on DockerHub. If you are having trouble getting the images you will need to login in to your Docker Hub account with the following command: docker login First Run If Using the docker-compose file the entrypoint secton of the AdminUI image will run migrations - there is more information on this in the docker-compose section below. Otherwise the container will just start AdminUI without running migrations. If you would like to see and/or modify which migrations are run please see our migrations documentation . Docker Demo Walkthrough To start browse to your hosts files, and add an entry as follows: <host ip address> ids On Windows, your host file is usually found at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts On Linux and MacOS, your host file is usually found at /etc/hosts To find your host ip you can run the following commands: macOS: ifconfig | grep \"inet \" | grep -v 127.0.0.1 Windows: ipconfig Linux: ifconfig If you are not using our AdminUI Integration IdentityServer included in the docker-compose file you do not need to add the IdentityServer (ids) mapping assuming your identityserver is publically resolvable or is running on the host machine. As of 3.1.2 the demo now uses nginx as a reverse proxy and https forwarding service. This works as detailed below: The docker demo is now started via a script file named StartIds.ps1 or StartIds.sh. The powershell script will run on all platforms with PowerShell core installed. If you do not have PowerShell core installed you can run the shell script. This shell script may need execute permissions ( chmod +x startIdS.sh ). The StartIds script creates a temporary container that builds a cert which is then placed in a shared volume. The script then runs the docker-compose up command. The Docker Compose builds and runs the 3 main containers using the 3 Dockerfiles provided. These Dockerfiles take our base images and install the cert created in step 1 of the script file. You will need to install the cert from the /cert folder after running the startIdS script and accept the certificate in browser on each website individually (on MacOS this needs to be done in Safari). Note - When installing the certificate On MacOS you must accept the following options for the certificate to install correctly: Please see the individual files for reference, starting with the StartIds.sh or StartIds.psh On startup the AdminUI image will use a script within the container that will wait for the MySql databse inside the compose-file and once this has fully setup will run migrations. You should now be able to access AdminUI on https://localhost:5010 . Modifying the docker-compose file If you want to modify any of the ports used in the demo please ensure you have edited them in both the nginx.conf and the docker-compose files. If you want to modify the docker-compose file to use a database setup outside of the docker-compose file or a database that isn't MySql you will need to change the configuration of the API. The entrypoint section of AdminUI is currently setup to wait for the DB container in the docker-compose file. To make the AdminUI container wait for your db you can pass in the IP of the database as the first parameter and the port as the second. e.g ui: entrypoint: /app/DbStart.sh host.docker.internal 1433 If you know your database will already be running it is possible to change this section to just run migrations like so: ui: entrypoint: dotnet IdentityExpress.Manager.UI.dll -migrate all && dotnet IdentityExpress.Manager.UI.dll Deploying Docker Images Separately Note - The base image is available at rocksolidknowledge/adminui . Ports used can then be set as -p 5000:5000 and environment variables as -e \"AuthorityUrl=http://ids:5003\" Making Docker Public with a Reverse Proxy To make the Docker containers public, we first need to add a web server to the mix. This web server will act as a reverse proxy, forwarding all calls to our running Docker instances. These web servers do not need to dockerized. IIS Reverse Proxy To setup IIS to act as a reverse proxy, there are two prerequisites that need to be installed within IIS: URL Rewrite Module Application Request Routing Once these are installed we can then go to the site we want to configure and select 'URL Rewrite' found in the IIS section. We then need to use \"Add Rule(s)...\", found in the Actions section. We can then use the Reverse proxy template, found in the Inbound and Outbound Rules section. Now we need to set the Inbound Rule, telling IIS where to forward requests to. By default this would be http://localhost:5000. If your Docker container is running HTTPS, ensure you disable SSL Offloading, ensuring TLS is maintained. We also need to configure an Outbound Rule, to allow IIS to return responses from our Docker container using your site URL instead of the Docker container responding directly. Here the From address needs to be the domain of your Docker container (e.g. http://localhost:5000) and the To address your sites address (e.g. api.docker.com). FAQ Why don't my Docker commands work on Linux? Ensure you have sufficient privileges. What do I do if I experience a port clash? You may experience a scenario where you have a clash between ports in-use on your host machine and the ports specified in the docker-compose.yml file. Port mappings in the docker-compose.yml file are specified in host:container pairs. You can change the host port in any mapping but be careful to change all occurrences of the usage of that host port in other environment variables used in the docker-compose.yml file. Connecting to Databases on Docker Host Machine To connect a container to a local database running on the Docker host machine, ensure you have configured the following: Enable remote connections to the database Enable firewall rule to allow connection using the configured port number Docker now provides host.docker.internal for connecting to the host e.g IdentityConnectionString=Server=host.docker.internal,1433;User Id=docker;Password=Welkom1234!;Database=IdentityExpressDb; Docker vulnerabilities scanning Before publishing docker images we run them through a security scan, checking for known CVE's in dependencies. However, vulnerabilities may be published after we release. In this instance we will do the following: Try update our base image (For both the UI and API this is the microsoft .net core image though this may not be updated to fix the CVE). If we cannot update our base image we will verify the and asses the issue. If Microsoft have not updated the issue and we deem it important we will patch our image. If we don't deem it to be an issue but you need it fixed, there are steps to patch the image yourself. Method 1. Use the docker run --user root <image name> command to gain root access in the container, apply the fix yourself and run docker commit to save the image and retag it with the CVE fixed. Method 2 (recommended). Create a dockerfile using the FROM command and change the user to root using USER root . For example in one of our alpine images there was a vulnerability discovered in apk-tools 2.12.5-r0. An example dockerfile that fixes this issue would look like the following: FROM rocksolidknowledge/adminui:5.2.1-alpine USER root RUN apk add apk-tools=2.12.7-r0 USER identityexpress We change the user back to identityexpress user after the fix as we don't want the default user to have root permissions.

Prerequisites Before getting started you will need a AdminUI License Key which you can get from our products page . Once you have a key, you will need to download the latest version of AdminUI from our downloads page . You will also need an IdentityServer installation and either a MySql, SqlServer or PostgreSql database set up. There is a sample IdentityServer available on our GitHub . If you are going to be using the IdentityExpress.Identity schema, make sure your IdentityServer is already set up to do so. A guide on how to do this can be found here . The above step is not necessary if you are going to be using a custom identity schema. Basic Installation Samples A sample of the below steps can be found in our sample repo on GitHub From Scratch Watch this video installation guide or follow the written tutorial below. When starting from scratch we recommend you create a project from the ASP.NET Core Empty template. This can be done through the Visual Studio GUI: Or from the .NET CLI using dotnet new web with your parameters of your choice. More info can be found in the Microsoft Documentation Get the AdminUI NuGet package You can install the Rsk.AdminUI NuGet package using the .NET CLI ( dotnet add package Rsk.AdminUI ), Powershell ( Install-Package Rsk.AdminUI ), or your GUI of choice. On first build the package will copy over the relevant static files into your wwwroot folder in a new admin folder e.g: wwwwroot/admin . On run it will serve from this folder on the base path of the project (e.g http://localhost:5000/). Configuration AdminUI specific config Please read our configuration page for more info You can find sample configuration in our sample repo UI Url - The URL AdminUI is run on -AuthorityURL - The URL of your IdentityServer. IdentityConnectionString - The database connection string of your Identity database IdentityServerConnectionString - The database connection string of your IdentityServer database AdminUIClientSecret - A random secret value LicenseKey - The key you were provided with when you purchased the product or obtained a demo Configure a Database & Migrations AdminUI currently only supports MySql, PostgreSQL, SqlServer, and SqlExpress. Any database must accept remote connections. Ensure that your firewall allows connections on any used ports. Migrations will run on app start by default. To configure which migrations run or to turn off migrations completely you can use the options in AddAdminUI. e.g: builder.Services.AddAdminUI(options => { options.MigrationOptions = MigrationOptions.None; }); Using the package Register AdminUI in your service collection, then add it to your application's pipeline. using IdentityExpress.Manager.UI.Extensions; var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); // Add services to the container. builder.Services.AddAdminUI(); var app = builder.Build(); app.UseHttpsRedirection(); app.UseAdminUI(); app.Run(); Using NuGet Package with Custom Identity Store The AdminUI NuGet package can be used as the foundations of a custom identity store . This will allow you to extend AdminUI's functionality around Users, Roles, and Claim Types. Using NuGet Package with Custom Database Connections In AdminUI 6.7 the AdminUI NuGet package uses a factory abstraction for creating database connections. You can replace the default implementation by providing a custom database connection factory . This will allow you to create connections according to your own needs. Running migrations manually AdminUI 6.7 adds the ability to programmatically run migrations manually. This can be done by turning off automatic migrations and using a new extension method thus: var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); builder.Services .AddAdminUI( options => { options.MigrationOptions = MigrationOptions.None; } ); var app = builder.Build(); app.RunMigrations(MigrationType.All); This can be done with or without a custom connection factory. The migration type is taken from the follwing enumeration: public enum MigrationType { Unknown, All, IdentityServerOnly, IdentityOnly, AdminUI, Configuration, ExtendedConfiguration, Operational, Identity, Audit, Saml, WsFed, DataProtection } Excluding Packaged UI Files If you have disabled the UI in AdminUI and wish to also not include the static web files in the the project you are using AdminUI in you can also configure the build to exclude them.

For typical users, Install AdminUI and demo IdentityServer we will handle some of the configuration for you and automatically run migrations and install IdentityServer example alongside AdminUI. For advanced users, Install AdminUI will allow you to configure the migrations and not install IdentityServer . For first time, or demo, users we recommend using Install AdminUI and demo IdentityServer . This screen displays the End User License Agrement (EULA). If you agree with the EULA please tick the check box to continue. All files will be installed to displayed location. We have prefilled this with a default install location for you. If you want to change the location select the Change button. IIS will need permissions to access the files in this location. Enter your AdminUI license key here, if you dont have a license key, you can request a demo from here Required Configuration Whether or not you are installing the example IdentityServer, you will need to set the following configuration for AdminUI Database provider: The database provider that you are using, avaliable options are SqlServer, MySql and PostgreSql IdentityServer connection string: The connection string to the database containing your IdentityServer configuration, if this database doesnt exist it will be created during the migration step later in the installer. Identity Connection string (Optional): An optional connection string for your Identity (users) database. Will default to your IdentityServer connection string. IIS Configuration You will then need to setup the following settings for the AdminUI IIS sites. IdentityServer Authority Url: The URL that your existing IdentityServer is running on, or the URL you want the demo IdentityServer example to run on. Website Url: The URL for the AdminUI UI site, will be added as a binding for the site in IIS Website Name: The IIS website name for AdminUI UI site. Audit Configuration Audit configuration. Audit read actions: Whether or not to audit read actions within AdminUI, for example when a user views a client through AdminUI. Defaults to false for typical installation. Audit culture: The language that the audit messages are generated in. Defaults to English (en-GB) for typical installation. Seperate audit connection string: An optional seperate connection string for storing audit messages. Defaults to your IdentityServer connection string on a typical installation. Logging Configuration for logging within AdminUI Enable Logging: Set whether or not to enable logging within AdminUI, enabled by default. Log Output Directory: The location to log to, IIS will need permission to read and write files at this location.

If you elected to install the demo IdentityServer we will automatically run migations using the connection string you supplied previously. We will attempt to run migrations, any errors that occur will appear once you select the failing migration. Before the IdentityServer migration, AdminUI will check the schema of your database and compare it to the expected schema. If your database doesn't contain any tables relating to IdentityServer, then the migration will run and add them accordingly. However if your database already has the required tables, AdminUI will skip the IdentityServer migration. Finally, if your database contains some but not all of the tables and columns required for the IdentityServer integration, the migration will not run, however you will be notified of the missing tables and columns. If you chose to install only AdminUI you have the opportunity to select which migrations you want to run.

The scripts are only available for SqlServer and would need to be modified to run for PostgreSql or MySql. Before running the migrations scripts you will need to backup your databases as there is no rollback script available from this point. To migrate your ASP.NET Identity Core schema to then be able to run further migrations you can use the script found here: Migration script . This requires you to have all AspNetUserClaims records to have a ClaimType value and will add columns and tables to your database.

I\u2019m stuck in a redirect loop If you are stuck in a redirect loop between AdminUI and IdentityServer, this is because AdminUI does not trust or cannot validate the IdentityServer identity token. A common cause for this is when one or more of the applications are running on HTTP rather than HTTPS. This can cause the browser\u2019s SameSite cookie policy to be enforced and AdminUI\u2019s correlation cookie to be unavailable. This correlation cookie contains security data used to verify incoming requests to AdminUI\u2019s redirect endpoint and validate tokens. If this cookie is not present, AdminUI will redirect the user back to IdentityServer. To solve this, ensure all of your applications are running on HTTPS and can validate one another's TLS certificates. If your applications are all running over HTTPS and you are still experiencing a redirect loop then your web server or reverse proxy could be terminating TLS. You will need to modify your web server or reverse proxy to tell AdminUI what the original request was by using X-Forwarded headers, such as X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto. This will tell AdminUI what the original scheme was (e.g. HTTPS) and the domain (e.g. identityserver.com). Check out the Microsoft documentation for more information on these headers and how AdminUI supports them here . Another common cause for redirect loops is header size limitations. If your max header length is too small to accommodate the AdminUI session cookie, AdminUI will be unable to authenticate and will enter a redirect loop. To fix this, increase the maximum header size for your AdminUI site. We recommend a value of at least 128KB. Invalid client secret If you see an error page within AdminUI after redirecting from IdentityServer to AdminUI, it may be that AdminUI is using an incorrect client secret. This can be proven by checking the IdentityServer logs for a failed request against the token endpoint. To resolve this, ensure that the AdminUI and API sites have the same value for the AdminUIClientSecret configuration setting. Once these are the same, restart the API website for the IdentityServer configuration to be updated. Invalid redirect URI If you see an error page or an error log within IdentityServer that says the redirect URI is invalid, this means that the client configuration held by IdentityServer does not match your AdminUI instance. To resolve this, ensure that the AdminUI API site has the correct URL for the UiUrl configuration setting. Once this is correct, restart the API website for the IdentityServer configuration to be updated. Invalid client If you see an error page or error log within IdentityServer that says the client is invalid, this means that IdentityServer does not recognize the AdminUI client application. This could be due IdentityServer and AdminUI not using the same database for IdentityServer configuration. To resolve this, ensure that both the AdminUI API and your IdentityServer are using the same connection strings.
